## Problem Statement

The aim of the project was to detect contrabands and IEDs in car X-ray images. [Product Link](http://www.smartimagingsystems.com/aaa-products-cxr-140-1s-car-x-ray-scanner.html)

* This involved pseudo coloring and enhancement of low resolution and noisy X-ray images 
* This was followed by contour detection and image segmentation to detect contrabands in the images


There was focus on real-time image enhancement with minimal computing ao that security personell can view them instantaneously. We had to experiment with several approaches to reduce the time for computation.


We experimented with CLAHE and unsharp marking algorithms for image enancements. We applied a U-Net model for the image segmentation task.
